# Slicer REST API

This page documents the HTTP API exposed by Slicer for managing micro-VMs, images, disks, and operations.

## Authentication

No authentication, ideal for local/dev work:

```yaml
config:
  api:
    bind_address: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
```

For production:

```yaml
config:
  api:
    bind_address: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    auth:
      enabled: true
```

The token will be saved to: `/var/lib/slicer/auth/token`.

Send an `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` header for authenticated Slicer daemons.

If you intend to expose the Slicer API over the Internet using something like a [self-hosted inlets tunnel](https://inlets.dev/), or [Inlets Cloud](https://cloud.inlets.dev), then make sure you use the TLS termination option.

i.e.

```bash
DOMAIN=example.com
inletsctl create \
    slicer-api \
    --letsencrypt-domain $DOMAIN \
    --letsencrypt-email webmaster@$DOMAIN
```

Alternatively, if Slicer is on a machine that's public facing, i.e. on Hetzner or another bare-metal cloud, you can use Caddy to terminate TLS. Make sure the API is bound to 127.0.0.1:

Caddyfile:

```
{
    email "webmaster@example.com"
    # Uncomment to try the staging certificate issuer first
    #acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # The production issuer:
    acme_ca https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
 }

slicer-1.example.com {
 reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

You can install Caddy via `arkade system install caddy`

## Conventions

- Content-Type: application/json unless noted.
- Timestamps: RFC3339.
- IDs: opaque strings returned by the API.
- Errors: JSON: { "error": "message", "code": "optional_code" } with appropriate HTTP status.

## GET /healthz

Check service liveness.

Response 200:
```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

## List nodes

HTTP GET

`/nodes`

```json
[{"hostname":"vm-1","ip":"192.168.137.2","created_at":"2025-09-02T08:32:37.667253315+01:00"}]
```

## List Host Groups

HTTP GET

`/hostgroup`

Response 200:

```json
[{"name":"vm","count":1,"ram_gb":4,"vcpu":2}]
```

## Create a new host within a Host Group

HTTP POST

`/hostgroup/NAME/nodes`

Add a host with the defaults:

```json
{
}
```

Or add a host with userdata:

Make sure the string for userdata is JSON encoded.

```json
{
  "userdata": "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade"
}

Add a host with a custom GitHub user to override the SSH keys:

```json
{
    "github_user": "your_github_username"
}
```

## Get serial console logs from a VM

HTTP GET

`GET /vm/{hostname}/logs?lines=<n>`

When `n` is empty, a default of 20 lines will be read from the end of the log.

When `n` is `0`, the whole contents will be returned.

Response 200:

```
[  OK  ] Started slicer-ssh-agent.
[  OK  ] Started slicer-vmmeter.
[  OK  ] Reached target Multi-User System.
         Starting Record Runlevel Change in UTMP...
[  OK  ] Finished Record Runlevel Change in UTMP.
```

## Delete a host within a Host Group

HTTP DELETE

`/hostgroup/NAME/nodes/HOSTNAME`

Response 204: No Content

## Get node consumption details

Providing that the `slicer-vmmeter` service is running in your VM, detailed usage and consumption metrics can be obtained.

HTTP GET

`/nodes/stats`

```json
[
  {
    "hostname": "vm-1",
    "ip": "192.168.137.2",
    "created_at": "2025-09-02T08:32:37.667253315+01:00",

```

### Execute a shell

HTTP GET

This is an internal endpoint used by `slicer vm exec` to obtain a shell. It requires the `slicer-ssh-agent` service to be running within the guest microVM.

`/vm/{hostname}/exec`
