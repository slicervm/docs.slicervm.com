# Tray integration

The tray app gives you quick access to VM status, logs, and shell access.

Start the tray and connect it to your local socket:

```bash
./slicer-tray
```

By default, the tray opens shells in Terminal.app. Use another terminal if you prefer:

```bash
./slicer-tray --terminal "ghostty"
```
